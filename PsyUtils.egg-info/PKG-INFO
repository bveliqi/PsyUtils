        The ``psyutils`` package is a collection of utility functions useful
        for generating visual stimuli and analysing the results of psychophysical experiments. It is a work in progress, and changes as I work. It includes various helper functions for dealing with images, including creating and applying various filters in the frequency domain.
        
        It is **NOT** an experimental display software package. It is intended
        to compliment something like [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org).
        
        It is intended only for internal use in [my](http://www.tomwallis.info) science at this stage. It is provided publicly to facilitate reproducibility of research. *Use these functions at your own risk.* Everything, including testing, is incomplete and open to change at any time.
        
        ## Submodules
        
         * ``image``. The ``image`` subpackage includes functions for filtering
          images and creating filtered noise stimuli, and otherwise interacting
          with images.
         * ``dist``: functions for creating probability distributions over axes. Currently just used to create filters.
         * ``im_data``. The ``im_data`` subpackage includes images and data for
          testing purposes.
         * ``files``: contains helper functions for working with directories and file structures.
         * ``psydata``: helper functions for working with psychophysical data (binary responses as a function of some stimulus).
         * ``misc``. This is a miscellaneous subpackage.
        
        ## Example Use
        
        You could do things like this::
        
            import numpy as np
            import psyutils as pu
            im = np.random.uniform(size=(256, 256))
            filt = pu.image.make_filter_lowpass(im_size, cutoff=8)
            im2 = pu.image.filter_image(im, filt)
            pu.image.show_im(im2)
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        See `setup.py` for current dependencies.
        
        ## Building
        
        To build the package, use:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        You can run unit tests by typing
        
        `nosetests -v --with-coverage --cover-package=psyutils`
        
        from the command line in the project's parent directory.
        
        ## TODO
        
          * more unit tests for filters, axes, windowing, misc
          * check documentation for filters
          * improve sphinx docs and linking
          * *remove* psydata submodule. This is not needed now that [psignifit](https://github.com/wichmann-lab/python-psignifit) is ported to Python.
        
        ## Contributions
        
        Thomas Wallis wrote the package. Many image processing functions are based on Matlab code from Peter Bex's lab. I also adapted some stuff from the scikit-image package.
        
        ## Thanks To
        
        Many of the image processing functions are based on Matlab functions originally written by Peter Bex. Tom Wallis also thanks Matthias KÃ¼mmerer and David Janssen for Python help and suggestions.
