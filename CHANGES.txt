v0.1.0, 2014.01.19 -- Initial release.
v1.0.0, 2014.05.12 -- version 1.0 release; abstracted grid creation from filters.
v1.0.1, 2015.07.26 -- Moved some functions into "plotting" submodule of psyutils.image. Only use freeimage plugin to save 16 bit images; otherwise defaults to scikit-image default plugin. Commented run_tests.sh since this didn't work as intended. Just call nosetests in my normal env for now. Added a dirty hack function to plot orientations.
